# NgCuriosity
Just a project for trying new Angular things.

## First Project: FullCalendar
Using [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/angular) to mess around with a planner-type thing. 

- [x] update to Angular 9
- [x] npm install --save @fullcalendar/angular 
- [x] npm install plugins
- [x] Import FullCalendar Module 
- [x] import plugins 
- [x] register plugins
- [x] Setup backend 
- [x] Migrate
- [x] Test API
- [] Make event service

### Notes
  You can update a remote database when these fire:
    eventAdd:
    eventChange:
    eventRemove:

  Made some models and controllers. Haven't tested yet.

### Issues
  - ~~Angry about getting members and events~~

## Second Project: Expandable MatTable
A catalog for all the hot bevs I have consumed. Coffee, tea, cocoa, etc.
Default view will display Brand, Name, Type, Subtype, Mood
Expanded view will display Image, Review

- [x] ng add Material
- [x] Make model
- [x] Make controller
- [x] Migrate
- [x] Test in Postman
- [ ] Table component
- [ ] Add link in nav-menu
- [ ] Add CaffeineLvl to model?
- [ ] And a Mat Slider for caffeineLvl!
