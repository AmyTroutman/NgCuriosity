# NgCuriosity
Just a project for trying new Angular things.

### Styling
Trying to do something different. I like the b&w bg-img with transparent colored tiles all over, but I want to do try to get away from that. At the moment (Oct 28, 2020), I'm still doing the stained glass thing. It just happened. 

## First Project: FullCalendar
Using [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/angular) to mess around with a planner-type thing. 

- [x] update to Angular 9
- [x] npm install --save @fullcalendar/angular 
- [x] npm install plugins
- [x] Import FullCalendar Module 
- [x] import plugins 
- [x] register plugins
- [x] Setup backend 
- [x] Migrate
- [x] Test API in Postman
- [ ] Make an interface!!
- [ ] Make Event API service
- [ ] Make Event service

### Notes
  You can update a remote database when these fire:
    eventAdd:
    eventChange:
    eventRemove:

  Made some models and controllers. Haven't tested yet.

### Issues
  - ~~Angry about getting members and events~~
